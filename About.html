    <h1><font color="#DC13A8">About</font></h1>
    <h3>Founder Of RGUKT</h3>
    <font size="4px">
    <li>The idea to create RGUKT germinated in April 2007, at a meeting between Prof. D.Raj Reddy and Prof. K.C. Reddy who then took idea to the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Dr. Y.S.Rajashekar Reddy. Dr. YSR by then was not happy with the opportunities available to the rural youth and wanted to start a University modeled on IIIT to exclusively concentrate on rural youth in imparting technology oriented higher education for bettering their employment potential</li>
    <li>A Task Force was created under the Chairmanship of Prof. K.C. Reddy, the then chairman APSCHE which recommended for establishing a technological University to benefit rural youth.</li>
    <li>In March of 2008, the AP Government created RGUKT with three campuses through an Act of the Legislature as a full-fledged university which would initially admit approximately the top 1% of the rural students into the three residential campuses located at RK Valley, Basara and Nuzvid.</li>
    <li>Prof. Raj Reddy as the founding Chancellor of the University for a decade guided the educational philosophy of the University and also moulded the academic journey to maintain not only its uniqueness but create significant impact on the quality of outcome and the student employment profile that later transformed their lives.</li>

    <h3>Why RGUKT?</h3>
    <font size="4px">
        <p>A person born into a low income, rural family in India struggles to aspire to study at an IIT or aim to be selected into the IAS. This is true in many cases. The reason for this is because they start with many inherent disadvantages such as:</p>
        <li>The educational level of the parents</li>
        <li>The quality of teachers and the schools they go to</li>
        <li>The ability to pay for coaching classes, and;</li>
        <li>The time and effort devoted to study the material;</li>
    </font>
    <h3>Management of RGUKT</h3>
    <font size="4px">
    <p>The management of the university is headed by the distinguished academician and able academic administrator, Prof. M. Vijaya Kumar as the Vice-Chancellor (FAC) chartering the university on the indelible legacy left by the earlier Vice-Chancellors Prof. V. Raj Kumar and Prof. V. Ramachandra Raju.
        The leaderships of the university is successful in finding benevolent, learner centered and committed academicians to head the four campus institutes of the university:</p>
