            One common method for getting students actively involved in the learning process is through laboratory classes. Though most often associated with the sciences and engineering, laboratory classes can be used by any instructor who wishes to create an environment where students are physically engaged with concepts in the field through active experimentation or exploration. Many learning objectives can be taught through laboratory classes. For example, through the laboratory experience students can do the following:
Develop deeper understanding of concepts. <br>
Experience phenomena directly.<br>
Connect book knowledge to real-world applications.<br>
Apply concepts to new situations and solve authentic problems.<br>
Develop thinking skills (critical, quantitative, qualitative).<br>
Develop data analysis skills.<br>
Develop experimental skills (e.g., design, observation, and use of equipment).<br>
Develop communication skills, including those involved in working in groups.<br>
Develop an appreciation for research in the field.<br>
