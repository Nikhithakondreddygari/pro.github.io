    <dl>
        <dt><i><u>Civil Engineering</i></u></dt>
        <dd>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the <mark>design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment </mark>, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.</dd>
        <dt><i><u>Mechanical Engineering</u></i></dt>
        <dd>One of the most diverse and versatile engineering fields, mechanical engineering is <mark>the study of objects and systems in motion</mark>. As such, the field of mechanical engineering touches virtually every aspect of modern life, including the human body, a highly complex machine.</dd>
        <dt><i><u>Electronics and communication Engineering</u></i></dt>
        <dd>ECE is an engineering branch that includes<mark> the production, design, research and testing of electronic devices and technology issues</mark> related to telecommunications systems, electronics, computers and related industrial sectors.</dd>
        <dt><i><u>Computer Science Engineering</u></i></dt>
        <dd>an academic program at many universities which<mark> comprises scientific and engineering aspects of computing</mark>. CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate the name of engineering informatics academic programs.</dd>
        <dt><i><u>Chemical Engineering</u></i></dt>
        <dd>Chemical engineering involves <mark>the production and manufacturing of products through chemical processes</mark>. This includes designing equipment, systems, and processes for refining raw materials and for mixing, compounding, and processing chemicals.</dd>
        <dt><i><u>Metallurgical and Materials Engineering</u></i></dt>
        <dd> a core branch of engineering that <mark>deals with the study of minerals, their processing and their transformation</mark>. The program comprises various aspects of minerals including their mechanical behaviour, physical metallurgy, thermodynamics, kinetics etc.</dd>
